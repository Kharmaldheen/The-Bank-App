# About The Bank App

The Bank App is built with HTML, CSS AND JS. it is a app that's made to mimick the real bank app where a user can log in and out. once the user puts in the correct username and pin, his account details will be rendered. The details will include the user's current balance, the total amount of money in and money out, the recent activities done by the user on the app, and the total interest the user has relative to the user's current balance. the user can also transfer money to another account, request a loan, close account and log out. Also all the users dates and currencies are displayed based on the locale of each user using the internalization API. Finally, Anytime a user logs in, a 5 minute timeout is set. Once the 5 mins. is reached, the user will be logged out and will need to log in again.

Happy Checking!!
