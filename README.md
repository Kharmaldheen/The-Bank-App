# About The Bank App

The Bank App is crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It functions as a simulated banking application, allowing users to seamlessly log in and out. Upon entering the correct username and PIN, the application renders the user's account details. These details encompass the current balance, total money in and out, recent activities conducted within the app, and the overall interest accrued relative to the user's current balance.

Users can engage in various financial transactions, such as transferring money to another account, requesting a loan, closing their account, and logging out. Additionally, all dates and currencies are displayed in accordance with the locale of each user, facilitated by the Internationalization API.

To enhance security, a 5-minute timeout is implemented every time a user logs in. Once this duration elapses, the user is automatically logged out and must log in again to access their account.

The Bank App supports two user accounts, each with a unique username and PIN. Here are the details for the two accounts:

Account 1:
Username: ak
PIN: 8787

Account 2:
Username: is
PIN: 9898

Happy Checking!!
